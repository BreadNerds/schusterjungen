## Tips
- Mix solid ingredients first, mix sour dough with the water separately, then add mix of solid ingredients and butter.
- Make your hands wet to prevent the dough from sticking to them.
- You can use an oiled casserole dish when putting the dough to rest. Use oil to prevent the dough
from sticking.
- Try not work the dough too much while forming the bread rolls to prevent them from becoming too
compact.
- To prevent the resting bread rolls from flattening out while resting, align them on baking paper and
fold it upwards between the rows, so they are tightened from the sides.
